## Release Cycle

Since January 2023, we've adopted a consistent release cycle for Nuxt, following [semver](https://semver.org). We aim for major framework releases every year, with an expectation of patch releases every week or so and minor releases every month or so. They should never contain breaking changes except within options clearly marked as `experimental`.

We are planning a slight variation from this plan for Nuxt 4 and Nuxt 5. Nuxt 4 will be a stability-focused release containing all `compatibilityVersion: 4` features, and will be followed shortly by Nuxt 5 which will include an upgrade to Nitro v3 and additional changes.

This approach separates breaking changes into manageable phases, allowing for better ecosystem testing and smoother migrations.

### Ongoing Support for Nuxt

We commit to support each major version of Nuxt for a minimum of six months after the release of the next major version, and to providing an upgrade path for current users at that point.

### Current Packages

The current active version of [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com) is **v4** which is available as `nuxt` on npm with the `latest` tag.

Nuxt 3 will continue to receive maintenance updates (bug fixes and security patches) until the end of July 2026.

Each active version has its own nightly releases which are generated automatically. For more about enabling the Nuxt nightly release channel, see [the nightly release channel docs](/docs/4.x/guide/going-further/nightly-release-channel).
